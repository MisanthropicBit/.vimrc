A repository for my .vimrc

Plugins I use:
 * NERDTree - A filesystem explorer
 * NERD\_commenter - Easily comment/uncomment code
 * Pathogen - Plugin manager
 * surround - Seemlessly add, change or delete surrounding quotes, parentheses and tags
 * repeat - Enable repeating of plugins through '.'
 * delimitMate - Autocompletion of quotes, parentheses and brackets
