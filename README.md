# Installation

Clone this repository, then optionally run `install.sh` to set up symlinks.

The `ultisnips` folder contains my custom snippets file with some additions.
This file should be linked via `g:UltiSnipsSnippetsDir` or the files added to an
existing path. See [the ultisnips plugin](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
for more information.
